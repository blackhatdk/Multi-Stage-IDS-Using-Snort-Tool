# MUTLI STAGE IDS USING SNORT TOOL


A Multi-Stage Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing the Snort tool represents a sophisticated cybersecurity solution designed to enhance network security by employing a multi-layered approach to threat detection and mitigation. At its core, Snort serves as the primary detection engine, leveraging signature-based analysis to identify known malicious patterns in network traffic. However, recognizing the limitations of signature-based detection alone, the IDS architecture integrates additional stages of analysis, including protocol inspection, anomaly detection, and behavior-based monitoring. These advanced techniques enable the system to identify novel and sophisticated threats that may evade traditional signature-based detection methods. Furthermore, the IDS architecture incorporates supplementary technologies such as sandboxing and threat intelligence feeds to bolster its detection capabilities and adapt to emerging threats in real-time. By combining the flexibility and effectiveness of the Snort tool with multi-stage analysis techniques and supplementary technologies, the Multi-Stage IDS offers organizations a comprehensive defense mechanism to mitigate the risks posed by evolving cyber threats and safeguard critical network assets.
